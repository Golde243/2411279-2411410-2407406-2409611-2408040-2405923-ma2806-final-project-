## Game overview

Our game is based on a cat and mouse in which the player is the mouse working their way through a maze made using collisions. The aim of the game is to use the wasd keys to navigate the maze, collect 3 cheese and get to the end whilst avoiding colliding with the cats that are following you.

## Individual Contributions

Evie - Created the tiles and collisions maps as well as introducing the enemy class of the cat and attempting to get it to follow the players co-ordinates at a specific speed. The code with the mouse being followed by the cat was originally working but has since broken and haven't managed to figure out how to fix it. Also attempted to do some debugging and was able to fix our code a few times through this but haven't been able to fix this version.

Liz - My contribution was originally adding in original art work for the game. The other members expressed how they wanted a birds eye view of the mouse, maze and cat so I did my best to implement that through pixel art. There is only one mouse design but I coloured 4 different cats, one for each theme of the map, as well as prepared tilemaps for 4 different seasons. In the file you will also be able to find prototypes of the original grassy land and hedges I had done but were unhappy with so I recoloured the ground to look less intesnse and changed the hedge for mudpatches. I also prepared 4 different rotations for the mouse as I also coded the direction he faces as he moves. Due to my previous project I added in a splash page for the beginning of the game and would like to have implemented a points sytem if I had more time. 

## Themes and Inspirations

Booleans, Collisions, Classes, Tilemaps, Movement, Rotation, Different stages and functions, Debugging, Display, if and else, for loops.

## Narrative

Since our game is broken we were unable to complete the full narrative - essentially the player has to collect the three pieces of cheese whilst avoiding the enemy cats and get to the end of the maze to complete.

## Anything We Would Add

As mentioned above we planned to have different seasons for multiple mazes (have attached the original artwork for these) but didn't manage to complete these in time. We wanted to code in collisions with the cats which would produce a game over screen as well as have the mouse able to collect the pieces of cheese - then when the player gets to the end of the game set it up so if they have collected all three cheese they can 'win' otherwise they have to go back. 

We also wanted multiple cats moving at different speeds. We wanted to implement a random feature for cats to have some random movement etc but again struggled to code this. 

We would've also wanted to add a point system where it shows how many pieces of cheese the player has collected in the corner and perhaps a time function too so create a sense of urgency in the game.
